## Editing App Packs <span id="editing"></span>

To edit the different app packs, go to the designated folder and open the config file available

Apps are layed out in a package format where the id of the package represents the name

To remove an app delete the package line dedicated to it.

For example, to delete VLC delete the following line:

```sh
<package id="vlc" />
```

## Adding Packages <span id="adding"></span>

To add a package, visit [chocolatey package search](https://chocolatey.org/packages) and look for a package and add it as a package line.

For example, to add gimp to a specific pack:

```sh
<package id="gimp" />
```

For manual install, open command prompt as an admin and type:

```sh
choco install gimp
```
